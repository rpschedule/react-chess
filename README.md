# React Chess
Chess written with the React framework

## Abandoned
This project has been abandoned and will no longer be updated nor maintained. The codebase was complicated to work with as no effort was put into organization. Also, the drag and drop framework was difficult to work with and caused problems I didn't know were possible. I may revisit the idea in the future, but it will be in a new repository. I am currently developing something somewhat similar on my main account ([battleship solitare](https://github.com/lgrom/battleship-solitare)). It has unit testing, object oriented programming, Jsdoc documentation, and actually works. Check it out if you'd like.
